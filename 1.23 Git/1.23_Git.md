# 1.23 Git

## Navigating Terminal/Anaconda Prompt/Git Bash
- `pwd` => **P**rint **w**orking **d**irectory (<=> display current location)
- `ls` => **L**i**s**t contents of current directory (Linux-based)
- `dir` => **Dir**ectory (Windows equivalent of `ls`)
- `cd <specified directory>` => **C**hange **d**irectory to <specified directory> within working directory

## Our Workflow:
- I post new materials to master
- You pull changes onto your branch
- You make changes and  commit them  on your local branch
- Repeat

## REMEMBER: Activate your environment:
- In 'terminal' (Linux/Mac): `source activate tds`
- In 'Anaconda Prompt` (Windows): `conda activate tds`


## Git (Main Uses)
[Cheat Sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/)

### Inspect status of repository
To show the un-committed changes in your repository (after you've made changes within the repo), use `git status`

### Clone (Copy) a repo from github
- Copy URL of repo of interest
- Navigate to desired directory in 'git-bash' (windows) or 'terminal' (Linux\Mac) using `cd`
- `git clone <paste url from clipboard> 

### Pull down latest changes from GitHub
- Pull changes of equivalent branch from GitHub: `git pull`

### Update your branch with changes from master using '[Rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase)' (Will be discussed further in future sessions!)
- `git rebase`

### Create Branches
Git allows for seperate streams of work to be maintained within a repo. Handy for managing development across multiple contributors. 
- View current branches: `git branch`
- Create new branch: 	`git branch <new branch name>`
- Checkout a branch: 	`git checkout <desired branch>`

### Track Changes
Git tracks **_changes_** within a repository. It only does so when you manually specify it to do so!
- See changes: `git status`
- Add changes: `git add <specify change listed>`
- Commit changes (to branch history): `git commit -m "<your custom message>"

### Push Changes (Only need to do this if you want to share your code!)
Git communicates with GitHub, a "remote" hosting site for repositories, to facilitate collaboration over the internet. It's what allows me to create materials for this workshop, and post it online for others to use!
- To start tracking your branch upstream: `git push --set-upstream origin <name of your branch>`
- Push your changes: `git push`

### Resolve Conflicts
- A way to handle conflicting changes in branch histories
- (A bit complicated, will be handled when it comes up)

### Merge Branches
- Will be done through GitHub

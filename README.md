# Welcome to *Python for Neural Networks* with Tulsa Data Science!

Every few weeks we will introduce and walk through neural network projects, with the intent of building enough familiarity to start your own!
Each week's workshop will begin with a demonstration, then open up to group activity and troubleshooting.
As well, we will (tentatively) follow [this syllabus](Syllabus.md)

## New to our workshops or need help setting up? Begin Here:
[Installation + Environment Setup](/1.16 Installation/1.16_Installation.md)

## New to Python? 
Our workshops are focused on Neural Network project development, and a certain level of comfortability with python is expected.  
However, we will devote time at the end of each workshop to answer questions and problem solve, so if you are stuck within a python learning module, feel free to join us. 

Follow our [resources page](Resources.md) for more!
